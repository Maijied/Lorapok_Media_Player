# Usage Guide

## Getting Started

### Opening Media
*   **Drag and Drop:** Simply drag any video file from your file explorer into the player window.
*   **Open File Button:** Click the "OPEN_FILE" button on the welcome screen or the folder icon in the control deck.

### Playback Controls
*   **Play/Pause:** Click the center circle button or tap the video area.
*   **Seek:** Click anywhere on the progress bar to jump to that timestamp.
*   **Speed Control:** Click the speed indicator (e.g., `1x`) in the bottom right to cycle through 0.5x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, and 2x speeds.

### Advanced Features
*   **Fullscreen:** Click the maximize icon (bottom right) to toggle immersive fullscreen mode.
*   **Smart Resume:** The player automatically saves your progress. Re-opening a file will resume exactly where you left off.
*   **Stats for Nerds:** Click the "Info" (i) icon to toggle the debug overlay, showing real-time resolution, duration, and filename statistics.

## Troubleshooting

**Video Stuttering (4K/8K)?**
Ensure your GPU drivers are up to date. The player is configured to use hardware acceleration by default.

**Format Not Supported?**
Currently supports MP4, WebM, and OGG. Full VLC codec support (MKV, AVI) is coming in v1.1.
